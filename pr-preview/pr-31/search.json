The Favorites extension provides a way for users to create their own personalized collection of important pages.\n\n\nHow It Works\nThe extension uses the browser’s localStorage to store the user’s favorites. This means:\n\nFavorites persist even after the browser is closed\nNo server-side processing is required\nThe solution works with static Quarto websites\nEach user’s favorites are stored on their own device\n\n\n\nTechnical Implementation\nThe extension consists of:\n\nLua filters that inject JavaScript, CSS, and HTML into pages\nClient-side JavaScript for managing favorites\nCSS for styling the favorites button and list\n\nSince Quarto generates static websites, all favorites functionality runs entirely in the user’s browser."
