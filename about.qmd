## About the Quarto Favorites Extension

This extension adds a simple but powerful feature to Quarto websites: the ability for users to bookmark or "favorite" pages for easy access later.

### Why Create This Extension?

When browsing large documentation sites or complex websites, users often need to return to specific pages repeatedly. The Favorites extension provides a way for users to create their own personalized collection of important pages.

### How It Works

The extension uses the browser's localStorage to store the user's favorites. This means:

- Favorites persist even after the browser is closed
- No server-side processing is required
- The solution works with static Quarto websites
- Each user's favorites are stored on their own device

### Technical Implementation

The extension consists of:

- Lua filters that inject JavaScript, CSS, and HTML into pages
- Client-side JavaScript for managing favorites
- CSS for styling the favorites button and list

Since Quarto generates static websites, all favorites functionality runs entirely in the user's browser.
